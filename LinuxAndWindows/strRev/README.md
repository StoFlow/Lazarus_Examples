This component provides an example of the usage of FontCombo.
It has been tested with Win11, Mint22 and Debian12.
The outcome differs slightly - some changes could be made to the look  ;-)

The example also illustrates some other techniques (nothing exciting).

Hints :
-------
- The program tries to save and restore the settings to/from a file (strRev.json) in the users home folder.
- For further info pls. see FontCombo readme and source codes.
